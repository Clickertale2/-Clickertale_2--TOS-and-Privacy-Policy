# **Privacy Policy**
**Effective from**: 31/03/2025 (DD/MM/YYYY)

**Author**: -Clickertale_2- Industries
This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how your privacy is protected when you use or interact with our works.

#### **1. What We Collect**
By default, we do not collect any personal data from users. However, some of our works may involve limited data collection strictly for functionality. This may include:
- Local storage of preferences or settings.
- Temporary session data (e.g., last selected theme, language, etc.).
- Non-identifiable error or debug information (for development tools or test builds only).

We do not collect:
- Names, emails, passwords, or contact information.
- Location data or IP addresses.
- Usage tracking or analytics without consent.

#### **2. How We Use Your Data**
Any data used or stored is solely for providing the features of our projects, extensions, or tools. We do not share, sell, or monetize your data - ever.
Data is used only to:
- Keep your settings or preferences saved.
- Help fix bugs or improve compatibility (in limited developer/test cases).
- Enable features that require temporary or local information.

#### **3. How Data Is Stored**
Most data is stored locally on your device (using LocalStorage, Scratch/TurboWarp cloud variables, or indexedDB, depending on the platform).
If an extension or project uses cloud variables, only non-personal, user-generated values are stored. We do not use cloud variables to store personal data.

#### **4. Children‚Äôs Privacy**
Our work is often used by children and educators. We intentionally design everything with privacy-first principles and do not collect any personal data from users under 13.
 We comply with standards like COPPA and other privacy laws aimed at protecting young users.

#### **5. Third-Party Platforms**
Some projects may run on or link to platforms like Scratch, TurboWarp, or GitHub. These platforms have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for how they handle your data.
We encourage you to read their privacy terms:

TurboWarp: https://turbo.warp/privacy
GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement

#### **7. Changes to This Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we‚Äôll notify users via changelogs or project descriptions.
 The latest version will always be accessible via our official pages or links in our projects.
