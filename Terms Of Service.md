- Agree to be bound by all of its terms.

#### **15.1 Collaborator Protections**
We value and support those who collaborate with us in a respectful, honest, and rule-abiding manner. As such, collaborators are explicitly covered and protected under this Terms of Service.
Collaborators are entitled to:
- Fair and transparent treatment.
- The opportunity to clarify misunderstandings or unintentional violations.
- A one-time chance for conditional reinstatement in the event of accidental involvement with banned users (see Section 16.5).
- Continued recognition for their contributions, provided they remain in compliance with this TOS.

Collaborators are not held responsible for another individualâ€™s actions unless they knowingly participate in or assist in violating this TOS.
However, this protection does not exempt collaborators from accountability. Any deliberate violation or continued association with banned users will override these protections and may lead to permanent removal (see Section 16.4 and 16.5).

#### **16. Lifetime Ban Policy - Zero Tolerance**
If you violate our TOS, you are banned permanently.
**No appeals.**
**No second chances.**
**If banned, you may not use, remix, access, or distribute any of our work, ever.**

#### **16.1 Helping a Banned User = You're Banned Too**
If you assist a banned user in any way, you will also be permanently banned.
This includes:
- Sharing our work with them.
- Letting them use your account.
- Collaborating with them on anything related to our work.

No exceptions.

#### **16.2 Applies to All Our Work**
This ban policy applies to everything we make, including:
- Projects.
- Games.
- Extensions.
- Assets.
- Collaborations with others and their work.

If you violate the ban in any area, you are banned from everything including stuff that is not listed here.

#### **16.3 Enforcement Measures**
We may:
- Publicly list banned users.
- Block access to our content on all platforms.
- Report violations to platform administrators.
- Take legal action if necessary.

**Banned = Banned forever.**
#### **16.4 Collaboration Restrictions**
If you're collaborating with a banned user, you must:
- Immediately stop working with them on anything related to us.
- Remove them from the project.

If you refuse, you will be banned permanently.
Anyone who helps you get around this policy will be banned too.
By refusing to comply, you forfeit the right to work with us or any of our collaborators - now or in the future.

#### **16.5 Conditional Reinstatement for Collaborators**
We recognize that some collaborators may unintentionally become involved with banned individuals. In such cases, we may, at our sole discretion, offer a one-time opportunity for reinstatement under strict conditions.
To be eligible for conditional reinstatement, a collaborator must:
- Publicly disassociate from the banned user and remove them from all current and future work related to us.
- Acknowledge their mistake and explicitly agree to comply with all Terms of Service going forward, including full cooperation with future enforcement actions.
- Accept that any future violation, no matter how minor, will result in a permanent, non-negotiable ban without warning.
- Submit a written request explaining the situation, their intentions, and how they will avoid future violations.

We reserve the right to deny any reinstatement request without explanation. Collaborators who are reinstated will be monitored more closely, and any attempt to assist banned users in the future will result in a lifetime ban with no eligibility for return.
Conditional reinstatement is available only to collaborators, and any violation after reinstatement will result in a permanent ban with no eligibility for future re-entry. Banned users themselves are never eligible for reinstatement. Once banned, always banned.

#### **17. Open-Source License for TurboWarp Extensions**
Certain works provided by **-Clickertale_2- Industries**, such as TurboWarp extensions, are governed by specific open-source licenses, including but not limited to the MIT License and Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0). These works may be freely used, modified, and redistributed according to the terms of these licenses, which are distinct from the terms of this TOS.

#### **17.1 MIT and MPL-2.0 License Rights**
Users are granted the rights to use, modify, and redistribute these works under the terms of the MIT or MPL-2.0 license, but they must follow the rules outlined in the respective license (e.g., attribution, inclusion of the original license). The permissions granted in these open-source licenses supersede the restrictions in this TOS regarding redistribution and modification of the code.

#### **17.2 Interaction with Open-Source Works**
While the open-source licenses govern the rights to use, modify, and distribute TurboWarp extensions and code, this TOS applies to all other aspects of interacting with our work, such as games, projects, assets, and non-code content. Users must follow the behavioral and usage rules set out in this TOS when interacting with our works, regardless of the licensing terms that apply to the code.

#### **17.3 Rights to Non-Open-Source Works**
Except for the open-source TurboWarp extensions, all other works provided by -Clickertale_2- Industries, including but not limited to games, projects, and assets, are not covered by open-source licenses and are subject to the full terms of this TOS. You may not modify, redistribute, or claim ownership of these works without explicit permission.

#### **17.4 Attribution for Open-Source Extensions**
If you modify or distribute any of our TurboWarp extensions under an open-source license, you are required to give appropriate credit to the original author and include the full text of the relevant open-source license (MIT, MPL-2.0) in your work. This obligation is in addition to the requirements of this TOS.
